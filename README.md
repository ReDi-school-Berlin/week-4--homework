# Homework for Week 3
_(Scroll down for some reminder on cloning this repository and making commits)_

## Exercises:
### Exercise 1
Write a function to check if a number is in a given range 
Example: Given the range 4 to 10, check if 5 is included
The expected result is True
You could also return a phrase like, “The number 5 is included in the range”

### Exercise 2
Create a function that will help us what to take with us by giving the weather
Examples:
If it’s sunny, your function will return “Take sunglasses”
If it’s raining, your function will return “Take umbrella”
If it’s snowing, your function will return “Take your gloves”
If it’s cold, your function will return “Take your jacket”
Add an option for when you don’t have the weather save, something like, try again 
Can you think about more conditions? Get creative!

## Bonus Exercise:
### Exercise 3

Create a function that produces a random integer integer between (0,100) and asks for user to guess the number.
If the user guessed number correctly, it prints to the console(terminal) "That's right! You guessed it! Congrats"
If the user could not guess it right, it prints "I'm sorry, but that's not correct."
