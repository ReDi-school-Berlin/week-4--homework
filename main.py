# YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
# For all the exercises below, test your function by calling it 
# (if it has parameters, test it with different arguments).

### Exercise 1
# Write a function to check if a number is in a given range.
# (Hint: you need 3 parameters, 2 for defining the range, 1 for the number you want to check.)
# Example: Given the range 4 to 10, check if 5 is included. The expected result is True.
# You could also return a phrase like, “The number 5 is included in the range”

# ------ ADD YOUR CODE BELOW: ------





### Exercise 2
# Create a function that will help us what to take with us by giving the weather
# (So the function has a parameter called weather.)
# Examples:
# If it’s sunny, your function will return “Take sunglasses”
# If it’s raining, your function will return “Take umbrella”
# If it’s snowing, your function will return “Take your gloves”
# If it’s cold, your function will return “Take your jacket”
# Add an option for when you don’t have the weather in your examples, something like, "Try again". 
# Can you think about more conditions? Get creative!

### Exercise 3

# Create a function that produces a random integer integer between (0,100) and asks for user to guess the number.
# If the user guessed the number correctly, it prints "That's right! You guessed it! Congrats"
# If the user could not guess it right, it prints "I'm sorry, but that's not correct."
# (hint: this function should not have any parameters)

### Bonus Exercise:

# This exercise is totally optional, but you can do it if you are up for a challenge.
# Remember the Exercise 2 from week 3 homework? Let's do it using an input() function this time.
# Assign a variable called occupation using the input() function, using a description to print,
# like "What is your occupation?".
# Similarly assign a variable number_of_children by asking a question
# (like "Give number of children") to the user using the input() function.
# For each child, ask the age of the child to the user similarly using the input() function, 
# and calculate the total benefit amount.

# The description of Exercise 2 from last week:

# Situation: Citizens apply for financial benefits from the government whose policy is to
# grant government employee benefits for only 2 of his children, 1.000Euro for each child
# if he/she is less than or equal to 20 years old.

# Write a set of codes using the conditional statements (if, else, elif) that checks
# the following conditions:
# - If citizen's occupation is a government employee, check if he has kids eligible for benefits,
# calculate the total benefit amount
# - If citizen's occupation is an entrepreneur, output the message "You make sure you pay your tax!"
# - If citizen has other occupation, output the message
# "This facility is only for government employees!
# 
# At the end output the message "Total benefit availed: " and total benefit amount
